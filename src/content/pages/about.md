  subtitle: Building community through creative recreation since 1940
intro: |
  The Eastern Cooperative Recreation School is a nonprofit organization established in 1940. For over seventy-five years, ECRS has offered recreation leadership training based on the belief that recreation is an important tool for teachers, social workers, and anyone else who works with people.

  We believe that play is fundamental to human experience, offering benefits like community building and personal growth. ECRS provides creative and engaging activities for all ages that are fun, build community and develop leadership.
philosophy: |
  At ECRS, we believe that recreation is more than just entertainment—it's a pathway to enriched living. Our programs emphasize enjoyment, creativity, cooperation, and personal growth. We create spaces where people of all ages can connect, learn, and play together in a warm and welcoming environment.
