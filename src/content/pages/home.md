  ## About

  *Want to play like a kid? Dance the cha-cha or a folk favorite? Foster close human relationships? Develop leadership skills? We offer fun activities – both active and relaxing – that emphasize enjoyment, creativity, cooperation and personal growth.*

  ECRS is a warm and welcoming community for folks of all ages. Join us at an event and explore an ever-changing menu of optional daily classes – from drama and dance to crafts and creating personal change – led by our skilled and caring leaders (who are also members!). Meals are family-style and there's plenty of planned downtime for relaxing, connecting, or sharing your own recreational activity. In the evening (and sometimes into the wee hours) we make our own merriment when we gather for the evening program, a smorgasbord of folk dancing, singing, informal dramatics and cooperative games.

Come experience for yourself at a one-day, weekend (including a camping weekend in early June), or our signature five-day-long Winter Adventure.'
