  title: What Makes ECRS Special?
  subtitle: Connecting, Creating and Playing
intro: |
  At ECRS, members gather together to engage in music, crafts, drama, dance, and games. But it's not just about the activities—it's about how we approach them. Here are the principles that guide everything we do.
principles:
  - title: Creating Our Own Fun
    icon: fa-paintbrush
    description: We believe enjoyment doesn't require costly packaged entertainment. Instead, groups create their own games, songs, skits, crafts, and dances—generating enjoyment, laughter, and creativity that comes from within.
  - title: Intrinsic Value
    icon: fa-gem
    description: We prioritize activities simply because they enrich our lives, not for competition or performance outcomes. The joy is in the doing, not in winning or impressing others.
  - title: Process Over Product
    icon: fa-seedling
    description: We focus on personal development and experience quality, asking "How was that for you?" rather than judging final results. Growth happens in the journey, not just the destination.
  - title: Community Focus
    icon: fa-users
    description: We provide genuine, quality human interaction to counteract the isolation that technology can create in modern society. Real connections happen when people play together.
  - title: Cooperative Activities
    icon: fa-handshake
    description: We explore working, playing, and creating together for the common good while respecting all individuals, regardless of age, race, sexual preference, competence, or social status.
  - title: Experiences Over Materialism
    icon: fa-heart
    description: We promote valuing meaningful moments over material possessions. The memories and relationships formed at ECRS events last far longer than any purchase.
