  title: History of ECRS
  subtitle: Over 80 years of building community through play
intro: |
  ECRS is a nonprofit organization founded in 1940 to provide cooperative recreation as a way to rest and refresh, to add richness and depth to living, and to aid the development of communities and humanity at large.

  For over seventy-five years, ECRS has operated based on the belief that recreation is a pathway to enriched living, serving educators, social workers, and anyone who works with people.
nameExplanation: |
  Our name tells our story:

  **Eastern** – We're based in the Eastern United States, with members and events primarily in the Northeast region.

  **Cooperative** – We operate collaboratively, with members sharing responsibilities for planning and running events. Everyone contributes, and everyone benefits.

  **Recreation** – We believe play is essential for mental health and well-being. Recreation isn't frivolous—it's fundamental to a balanced life.

  **School** – Learning is at the heart of what we do. We teach recreation leadership skills that participants can bring back to their own communities.

  - title: The Early Years
    content: |
      ECRS was founded with a mission to develop recreation leaders who could bring the joy of cooperative play to their communities. The Leadership Development Committee played a key role in evaluating competencies and helping members grow as facilitators and teachers.

      From the beginning, ECRS emphasized learning by doing. Participants didn't just attend classes—they learned to lead them. This apprenticeship model remains central to our approach today.
  - title: ECRS Evolving
    content: |
      Over the decades, ECRS has expanded its programming to include new forms of creative expression. While we've maintained our traditional core activities—folk dancing, singing, games, and dramatics—we've also embraced new offerings.

      Today's ECRS events might include self-exploration classes, role-playing games, drumming circles, puppetry workshops, and mindfulness practices. We continue to evolve while staying true to our founding principles of cooperation, creativity, and community.
