## Join us for a weekend of ECRS fun and community at a new location!

Newcomers and ECRS veterans alike will love a weekend of pure play at Pendle Hill. Dive into daytime classes that spark your curiosity – dancing, singing, informal dramatics, crafts, or games. Then Friday and Saturday nights, the whole community comes together for folk dancing, singing, games, and good conversation over snacks. All ages, all welcome.

## About Pendle Hill

Pendle Hill is a historic Quaker retreat center (since 1930) nestled on 24 wooded acres in Wallingford, PA – just outside Philly. Between activities, explore the grounds, browse the bookstore, or cozy up in the library.

**Accommodations** feature twin beds in private or shared rooms with hall baths. Expect delicious family-style meals with organic garden produce (vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free available). Easy access via Regional Rail or a 20-minute drive from PHL airport.
