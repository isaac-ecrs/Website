          <p>
            Since 1934, the Evangelical Covenant Recreation Service (ECRS) has been dedicated to
            empowering children through recreation and service. Our mission is to provide meaningful
            experiences that help young people discover their potential, build lasting friendships,
            and develop leadership skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a blend of traditional activities and innovative programming, we create environments
            where children can explore, learn, and grow. From singing and dancing to crafts and games,
            every activity is designed with intention and care.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our trained leaders bring passion and expertise to every program, ensuring that each child
            feels valued, supported, and inspired to reach their full potential.
