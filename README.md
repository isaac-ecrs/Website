## CMS

Content is managed via [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) at `/admin/`. Authentication uses GitHub OAuth proxied through a Cloudflare Worker (`sveltia-cms-auth`). Changes are committed directly to `main` and trigger an automatic Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger CI (build, unit tests, E2E tests, type check) and an automatic Cloudflare Pages deployment. No manual steps required.
